## [Anatomy of JavaScript Method Chaining](js-chain)

In this article, we will try to distill method chaining to its essence, making a distinction of mutable vs immutable chaining, and draw some parallels with composition in functional programming.

## [Functional JavaScript: An Example of Equational Reasoning](js-functional-array)

In this article, I will demonstrate equational reasoning by focus on a key data structure in javaScript: Arrays. Alternatively, proving monad laws mathematically with javaScript syntax.

## [Test Population Median Equality for Discrete Distributions](on-median)

Simulation based examination of various statistical tests for median equality null for discrete r.v.: T-test, Wilcox rank sum, Mood Test and Bootstrapping. Findings:

* If we know nothing about the population, all of the proposed tests are not reliable

* Mood Test tends to reject more often, it might be a good test for contentious distributions, but turns out to be a poor fit for discrete distributions, which can have identical medians yet fail to satisfy Moodâ€™s Test  condition

* Subsampling/Bootstrapping tend to over-reject as well, especially when sample median is biased

* When population mean and population median can be assumed to be equal, T Test is very robust despite its obvious theoretical shortcomings

* Wilcox rank sum test is a general close second following T Test, and has good robustness
