Simulation based examination of various statistical tests for median equality null for discrete r.v.: T-test, Wilcox rank sum, Mood Test and Bootstrapping. Findings:

* If we know nothing about the population, all of the proposed tests are not reliable

* Mood Test tends to reject more often, it might be a good test for contentious distributions, but turns out to be a poor fit for discrete distributions, which can have identical medians yet fail to satisfy Moodâ€™s Test  condition

* Subsampling/Bootstrapping tend to over-reject as well, especially when sample median is biased

* When population mean and population median can be assumed to be equal, T Test is very robust despite its obvious theoretical shortcomings

* Wilcox rank sum test is a general close second following T Test, and has good robustness
